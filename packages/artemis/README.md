## General Usage
To use the app as a member of TechCodes, go to the [app](https://app.techcodes.org), login with a google account (please use the same one each time, and preferably use a school gmail), and then, if it is your first time signing on, enter your OSIS. Please use your actual OSIS so that we can give you club credits! (but you can change this in the settings if you make a typo).

### Dashboard
When you get to the app dashboard you will be able to see your points and any other metadata, such as the number of meetings you have attended, as well as the links you have redeemed, whether from attendance, an event, or something else. On the sidebar near the bottom you will be able to find a settings icon, where you can currently change your OSIS if you mistyped it originally, and eventually probably much more. In the future we hope to use the app for more things such as hosting events, but for now, that's it!

### Links
When you attend club meetings or events we will have links that you can go to, either using the QR code, or by copy and pasting. Once you go to the link you should receive the points and we will have logged that you were there.
